##### _testing a frontend application | app developed by Trybe_

The goal of this project was to write tests for the application, implementing Unit Tests using <a href="https://jestjs.io"> Jest</a>:zap: and the React Testing Library (<a href="https://testing-library.com/">RTL</a> :octopus:).

This application simulates a 'Pokedex', allowing users to view and favorite a variety of Pokemon organized by their types, with additional details available for each selection.
