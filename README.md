##### _testing a frontend application | app developed by Trybe_

The goal of this project was to write tests for the application, implementing Unit Tests using <a href="https://jestjs.io"> Jest</a> and the React Testing Library (<a href="https://testing-library.com/">RTL</a>).

This application simulates a 'Pokedex', allowing users to view and favorite a variety of Pokemon organized by their types, with additional details available for each selection.

#### :zap: Habilitites

- Use React-Testing-Library selectors (queries) in automated tests.

- Simulate events with React-Testing-Library in automated tests.

- Test asynchronous logic flows with the React-Testing-Library.

- Write tests that allow the structure of application components to be refactored without having to change them.

- Create mock APIs using fetch.

- Test inputs.

#### :zap: Instructions to run the tests

_Verify all dependencies and libraries to ensure smooth functioning of the application_

> You'll need to have installed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a> :warning: locally (in your machine) to run the application.
